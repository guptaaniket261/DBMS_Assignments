14 -  Suppose hometeam A has played in common against hometeam Leicester (say B). So both A and B have played with a common team (say C). Suppose A also played with team D, where B has never played with D. So, do we have to include match (A, D) as well if homegoal - awaygoal > 3. Or do we need to account for only those matches in which the awayteam has played against both A and B.
yes, as we will be considering all the matches with hometeam A
